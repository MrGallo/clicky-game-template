# Clicky Game

### Required concepts
- Pygame drawing ([Chapter 5](http://programarcadegames.com/index.php?chapter=introduction_to_graphics&lang=en))
- Pygame animation ([Chapter 8](http://programarcadegames.com/index.php?chapter=introduction_to_animation&lang=en))
- Pygame mouse/keyboard events ([Chapter 10](http://programarcadegames.com/index.php?chapter=controllers_and_graphics&lang=en))
- If-statements
- Loops

Create a game based on mouse clicks. Think *Temple Run*, *Cookie Clicker*, *Flappy Bird*, even the Chrome *No-Internet-Connection-Dinosaur-Jumping-Game*. Put your working, most up-to-date code in `main.py`. Group members may choose to create other files to work within temporarily and to isolate their own contributions.

Although this is a groups project, each member will be assessed individually based on their contributions. If a particular member is not contributing, they will be asked to decouple from the group and turn in something on their own.

## Pygame Template
Use this [pygame template](https://gist.github.com/MrGallo/879bde988affcb6c6c4695d8de1910f7) to start your clicky game.

## Timeline
- **Day 1**: Get assignment and get into groups
- **Day 3**: Get feedback on GitHub **(worth 40%)**
- Address/resolve feedback and prep for final submission
- **Day 6**: Final submission assessed (only if feedback has been addressed) **(worth 60%)**


## Submission requirements
1. Each member must clearly mark their code with a comment indicating who did what.

    ```python
    # MR. GALLO
    if code_not_attributed:
        mark = 0
    ```
2. Each member will pick examples from their own code highlighting each of the required concepts (more focus on if-statements and loops) and *be able to explain the code* as well as answer questions.
3. The group will have a conference call with the teacher to present their program. This means everyone needs a working microphone. If this is an issue, please let me know **as soon as possible**.

**It will not be acceptable:**

- for multiple group members to contribute on all the code. There must be clear and substantial spans of code that were written by only one person.
- for multiple group members to re-purpose another member's code, changing only accidental aspects of the code and keeping the general structure the same (the English essay Thesaurus technique for plagiarising paragraphs).

## The Conference
- Each member will present their code individually, although one member can be reasponsible for screen-sharing the code for everyone.
- There will be a four minite time limit
- Speak pricipally about:
    - What feedback I gave you and how you implemented it (or why you chose not to)
    - Your use of:
        - Variables
        - If statements
        - Loops (optional)
- I may inturrupt during the presentation to ask questions.

## FAQ
**1. Where can I find the feedback you gave me?**

Feedback is in this repository, in the Pull Requests tab. Under "Feedback". Please respond to comments and ask questions there (just to keep everything related in one place).
